## Seeing the world from a thermal perspective
Infrared imagery offers a unique opportunity to see biophysical properties in real time. We can watch organisms heat up, cool down, and generally transfer heat back and forth throughout their environment. In the TrEnCh Project, we use infrared imagery to help people see the world from a thermal perspective because we believe itâ€™s an intuitive first step to understanding microclimate and the impacts of warming.
