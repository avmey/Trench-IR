              <h2 class="h1">How King Penguins Regulate Their Temperature</h2>
            </header>
            <p>King penguins (<i>Aptenodytes patagonicus</i>) live in extreme environments of Antarctica. On land, they experience temperatures below -20˚C. Here, they maintain surprisingly high core temperatures (~37˚C). At sea, staying warm is even more challenging, because penguins lose heat much faster in water than in air. This is because water has a much higher <i>thermal conductivity</i> than does air.</p>
            <p>From these insights, we know that king penguins will be the coldest, or most <i>thermally stressed</i>, when they are fishing in the water. How can they survive these harsh temperatures? Many sea mammals stay warm with insulating layers of thick fur or fat on their bodies. King penguins have both layers of fat and a dense coat of feathers. However, their fins and feet are more exposed. Their feet are naked, and their flippers have only short feathers. King penguins are adapted to let their flippers and feet -- their <i>appendages</i> -- remain colder than their main body -- their <i>core</i>. When swimming, they massively reduce the amount of blood going in and out of their appendages, a process called <i>vasoconstriction</i>, which makes their veins smaller so less blood goes through them. This reduces heat loss to the water and reduces heat exchange between the appendages and the penguin's core. This way, a penguin's cold feet and flippers don't send much cold blood back to their core body, which would cool down their core temperature.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/king-penguins-vaso.jpg" style="width:40%; margin-top:50px"></p>
            <p>King penguin veins are also structured so the warm blood from their heart passes close to the cold blood returning from their appendages. This warms the returning blood, reducing even further the cold blood coming into their core body. This is called <i>counter-current heat exchange</i>. Both adaptations can reduce heat loss to 2-6% of total heat loss compared to 19-48%.</p>
            <p><img src="/images/king-penguins-countercurrent.jpg" style="width:40%; margin-top:50px"></p>
            <p><small>Counter current heat exchange, suaing a dog paw as an example. We can see that <i>without</i> counter-current heat exchange (top), the blood coming from the paw to the core body (blue) is 16˚ by the time it gets back from the paw. However, <i>with</i> counter-current heat exchange, the blood coming from the paw to the core body (blue) is 36˚ by the time it gets back from the paw. A big improvement! This is possible by havinh the veins closer together, so the blood being sent from the warm core body warms up the returning blood.This is the same process penguin feet (and many cold-weather birds' feet) use to keep warm!</small></p>
            <br>
            <p>Q1: What is more important: appendage temperature or core body temperature? Why?</p>
            <p>Q2: Reflect on why these adaptations are important for king penguins in their habitat.</p>
            <br>
            <p><img src="/images/king-penguins-hypothermic.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-top:75px"></p>
            <p><i>Hypothermia</i> occurs when your internal temperature is too cold. King penguins, depending on how long they stay in cold waters, can become partially or fully hypothermic. A penguin is partially hypothermic if only its appendages are at a low temperature, but its core body is at a normal temperature. A penguin is fully hypothermic if its core body temperature is also low.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Penguins need to stay warm, but they sometimes are at risk of overheating — even in the Antarctic! When king penguins are active on land, they are generating extra metabolic heat and can risk overheating because their superb insulation (feathers, fat) reduces heat loss. However, a penguin's feet are naked, and its flippers have small feathers. Because their feet and flippers have limited insulation, they act as <i>thermal windows</i>, which are spots of a body where heat can be lost quickly. (You can think of thermal "windows" working like normal windows: open a window or close a window to let heat in or out). By controlling exposures of flippers and feet to the cold Antarctic air, king penguins can finely control heat loss and thus their internal body temperature.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q3: How are king penguins able to control their core body temperature using their feet?</p>
            <p>Q4: Why are penguin feet and flippers not more insulated to keep them warmer?</p>

            <p><img src="/images/king-penguins-thermoregulation.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-top:75px"></p>
            <p>Q5: Note the differences in position between the thermal windows (flippers and feet) of these two penguins. Which penguin is warming up and which penguin is cooling down? What informs your decision?</p>

            <p>An infrared camera can calculate the surface temperature of everything in the frame. The camera does this by using the radiation emitted by objects. It's important to note that it can only observe surface temperatures, and not the core temperatures of large mammals. You can learn more about how thermal cameras work on our Science page.</p>

              <h2 class="h1">The Experiment</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Researchers wanted to study how penguins warmed back up after long hunting trips in the sea. They decided to use thermal imaging cameras to study these processes. Due to a penguin's thick coat, the thermal camera cannot identify a penguin's core temperature, only it's surface temperature. However, researchers could study how penguins thermoregulate using their flippers as thermal windows.</p>
            <p>Researchers were particularly interested in this question: Do penguins which are partially hypothermic warm up differently than penguins that are fully hypothermic? Do partially and fully hypothermic penguins stop vasoconstriction at different times when warming up?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q6: What is your hypothesis?</p>

            </small></p>
            <br>
            <p>Q7: How do the temperatures of the flipper and chest differ at the beginning?</p>
            <p>Q8: What is the last part of the penguin's body to warm? Why do you think this is?</p>\
            <p><img src="/images/king-penguins-chart.jpg" style="width: 50%; margin-top:75px;"></p>
            <p><small>Mean (with standard error bars) temperature of king penguin flippers, as a function of time on land. Fully hypothermic birds are represented by filled squares and solid lines; partially hypothermic birds are represented by light squares and dashed lines.<br>(Note: Edited from original by removal of wild-colony and year-one lines.)</small></p>
            <br>
            <p>Q9: What differences do you notice between the fully and partially hypothermic populations?</p>
            <br>
            <p>The researchers found a 5-minute delay to flipper warming in fully hypothermic penguins. There is no delay to flipper warming in partially hypothermic penguins. Why might that be? One possibility is that core temperature warming took precedence over flipper warming. Researchers think that the hypothermic penguins continued to vasoconstrict their flippers to focus on raising their core (chest) temperature during the first 5 minutes represented in the graph. Then, once their core temperature was back to normal, they ended vasoconstriction to allow their flippers to begin warming.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q10: Consider why king penguins would have adapted to warm up this way. What are the benefits of regaining a normal core temperature before regaining flipper temperature?</p>

            <p>Researchers found that most of a penguin's body that is covered by thick feathers was, on average, 4 to 6 degrees Celcius colder than the air temperature. This is due to <i>radiative cooling</i>, which is when a warm object releases heat the cold surrounding air. The penguins' feathers release heat to the cold sky, leaving their surface colder than the air temperature.</p>

            <p>Luckily for the emperor penguins, their thick coats of feathers help them retain a higher internal temperature than the surface of their feather coats. You can see this with a thermal image: the penguin's eyes, feet, and flippers are closer to their internal temperature than their body.</p>

            <p>Along with their thick feathers, emperor penguins use huddling to warm themselves up. By pressing together, they reduce how much radiative cooling happens. They also block themselves from wind. Some penguins are on the outside of the huddle, which means they take the brunt of the wind. Luckily, the huddle swirls, like a tornado, and the one who are on the outside of the huddle get brought inside, so they can warm up too. From sharing body heat, the center of a penguin huddle can reach temperatures of up to 37 degrees Celsius!</p>
