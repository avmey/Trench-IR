              <h2 class="h1">How King Penguins Regulate Their Temperature</h2>
            </header>
            <p>King penguins (<i>Aptenodytes patagonicus</i>) live in extreme environments. On land, they experience temperatures below -20ËšC. Here, they maintain surprisingly high core temperatures (~37 degrees Celsius). At sea, staying warm is even more challenging, because water cools the penguins down faster than air. This because air has a lower <i>thermal conductivity</i> than water.</p>
            <p>From these insights, we know that king penguins are the coldest, or most <i>thermally stressed</i>, when they are in the water fishing. How can they survive these harsh temperatures? Many sea mammals stay warm with thick fur or fat on their body. King penguins have both layers of fat and a dense coat of feathers. However, their fins and feet are more exposed. Their feet are naked, and their flippers have only short feathers. King penguins are adapted to let their flippers and feet -- their <i>appendages</i> -- remain colder than their main body -- their <i>core</i>. They massively reduce the amount of blood going in and out of their appendages, a process called <i>vasoconstriction</i>. This reduces heat exchange between the appendages and their core body. This way, a penguin's cold feet and flippers don't send much cold blood back to their core body, which would cool down their core temperature. King penguin veins are also structured so the warm blood from their heart passes by the cold blood from their appendages to warm it up, reducing even further the cold blood coming into their core body. This is called <i>counter-current heat exchange</i>. Both adaptations can reduce heat loss to 2-6% of total heat loss compared to 19-48%.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q1: What is more important: appendage temperature or core body temperature? Why?</p>
            <p>Q2: Reflect on why these adaptations are important for king penguins in their habitat.</p>
            <br>
            <p><img src="/images/king-penguins-hypothermic.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-top:75px"></p>
            <p>Hypothermia occurs when your internal temperature is too cold. King penguins, depending on how long they stay in cold waters, can become partially or fully hypothermic. A penguin is only partially hypothermic if only its appendages are at a low temperature, but its core body is at a normal temperature. A penguin is fully hypothermic if its core body temperature is also low.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q3: Why are penguin feet and flippers not more insulated to keep them warmer?</p>
            <br>
            <p>While it is important, especially in the Antarctic, for penguins to stay warm, it is also important for penguins not to overheat. When king penguins are on land for a long time and are being active, there is a possibility of overheating. This is why a penguin's feet are naked and their flippers have shorter feathers. Areas of an animal's body that are less insulated and allow them to cool off are called <i>thermal windows</i>. Little heat escapes from a penguin's core body, but they can cool down using their flippers and feet. By exposing more of their flippers, king penguins can finely control their internal body temperature.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q4: How are king penguins able to control their core body temperature using their feet?</p>

            <p><img src="/images/king-penguins-thermoregulation.jpg" style="width:50%; margin-top:75px"></p>
            <p>Q5: Noting the differences in position between the thermal windows (flippers and feet) of these two penguins, which penguin is warming up and which penguin is cooling down? What informs your decision?</p>

            </header> 
            <p>An infrared camera can calculate the surface temperature of everything in the frame. The camera does this by using the radiation emitted by objects. It's important to note that it can only observe surface temperatures, and not the core temperatures of large mammals. You can learn more about how thermal cameras work on our Science page.</p>

              <h2 class="h1">The Experiment</h2>
            </header>
            <p>Researchers wanted to study how penguins warmed back up after long hunting trips. They decided to use FLIR thermal imaging cameras to study these processes. Due to a penguin's thick coat, the thermal camera cannot identify a penguin's core temperature, only it's surface temperature. However, researchers could study how penguins thermoregulate using their flippers as thermal windows.</p>
            <p>Researchers were particularly interested in this question: Do penguins which are partially hypothermic warm up differently than penguins that are fully hypothermic? Do partially and fully hypothermic penguins stop vasoconstriction at different times when warming up?</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q6: What is your hypothesis?</p>

            </small></p>
            <br>
            <p>Q7: How do the temperatures of the flipper and chest differ at the beginning?</p>
            <p>Q8: What is the last part of the penguin's body to warm? Why do you think this is?</p>\
            <p><img src="/images/king-penguins-chart.jpg" style="width: 50%; margin-top:75px;"></p>
            <p><small>Mean (with standard error bars) temperature of king penguin flippers, as a function of time on land. Fully hypothermic birds are represented by filled squares and solid lines; partially hypothermic birds are represented by light squares and dashed lines.<br>(Note: Edited from original by removal of wild-colony and year-one lines.)</small></p>
            <br>
            <p>Q9: What differences do you notice between the fully and partially hypothermic populations?</p>
            <br>
            <p>The researchers found a 5-minute delay to flipper warming in fully hypothermic penguins. There is no delay to flipper warming in partially hypothermic penguins. Why might that be? One possibility is that core temperature warming took precedence over flipper warming. Researchers think that the hypothermic penguins continued to vasoconstrict their flippers to focus on raising their core (chest) temperature during the first 5 minutes represented in the graph. Then, once their core temperature was back to normal, they ended vasoconstriction to allow their flippers to begin warming.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Q10: Consider why king penguins would have adapted to warm up this way. What are the benefits of regaining a normal core temperature before regaining flipper temperature?</p>

            <p>Adapted from <u><a href="https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsbl.2012.1192">McCafferty D. J., Gilbert C., Thierry A.-M., Currie J., Le Maho Y. and Ancel A. 2013</a></u></p>

            <p>Researchers found that most of a penguin's body that is covered by thick feathers was, on average, 4 to 6 degrees Celcius colder than the air temperature. This is due to <i>radiative cooling</i>, which is when a warm object releases heat the cold surrounding air. The penguins' feathers release heat to the cold sky, leaving their surface colder than the air temperature.</p>

            <p>Luckily for the emperor penguins, their thick coats of feathers help them retain a higher internal temperature than the surface of their feather coats. You can see this with a thermal image: the penguin's eyes, feet, and flippers are closer to their internal temperature than their body.</p>

            <p>Along with their thick feathers, emperor penguins use huddling to warm themselves up. By pressing together, they reduce how much radiative cooling happens. They also block themselves from wind. Some penguins are on the outside of the huddle, which means they take the brunt of the wind. Luckily, the huddle swirls, like a tornado, and the one who are on the outside of the huddle get brought inside, so they can warm up too. From sharing body heat, the center of a penguin huddle can reach temperatures of up to 37 degrees Celsius!</p>
